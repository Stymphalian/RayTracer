As can be seen multi-threading provides significant improvements to rendering times.
From 1 thread to 8 threads we see around 1.8 times increase in speed.
We note that the increases in speed are not linear. The gains from 1 thread to 2
threads were significant (~1.35),but the gains between from 6 to 7 threads were less so.
We also note several cases in which the additional thread actually decreases perfomance.
This may be accounted for by several factors:
    - Bad testing. These data points were only sampled once.
    - My implmentation of the threads splits the work unevenly amoung the threads.
        For example, one thread may have very little work and finish early,while
        the other threads are given a heavier workload.This causes cases in which
        even though n threads are created,some of the threads may terminate early
        and not contribute to the processing.
